So I hope you got from that, that it
wasn't trivial. It wasn't like somebody just walked out
and said, hey make a network. I mean, there were forces, 
powerful forces, the "telecom lobbyists", 
that did not want this to happen. And we will, we will see these telecom
lobbyists a couple times as we progress through this lecture.
So Larry Smarr and the folks that made the supercomputers convinced Congress to
authorize the, the giving of a grant to build the National Science 
Foundation's network. It was going to use the TCP/IP protocol
that the ARPANET had built. It was supposed to be inclusive, 
at least for research academics. And it was, you know, research
universities would, we want to get them connected. And so our story 
now leads from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign
to my university, the University of Michigan. Now, if you take a 
look at this ARPANET picture that was sort of right before,
now it's at 1972. But if you look at all of the ARPANET
pictures there is a glaring omission, from my perspective.
Glaring omission on all of these. I wonder, why aren't we there? Well,
there's a very good reason why the University of Michigan is not on any of
the ARPANET pictures. And that's because we 
built our own network. We built a network using leased lines, a
three-node network between Michigan State University, University of Michigan, and
Wayne State University. We were sharing each other's 
compute resources. We were using each other's 
computers interactively. We were playing online multi-user games.
We called them adventures, they were all based on text.
But they were great fun, and they were great community building.
We had chat forums, we had all kinds of things, we used each other's software.
It was, it was a cool little world. And the ARPANET wasn't seen by many 
as all that significant. It was kind of an experiment, right.
It was a research project, and we were a research, we were production.
Merit was production and ARPANET was research.
So there you go, right? So there was actually a lot of these like
nascent networks out there, early days. And so the University of Michigan sort of
never really was significantly involved in the ARPANET work.
But the University of Michigan, being a large university, did want to get a
supercomputer center. And because of some strategic blunders, as
Doug Van Houweling will soon explain to you, Michigan didn't get a
supercomputer center. And so the idea was, is we would do what
it was going to take to get the network, because that might be more fun.
So Doug Van Houweling at the time was the chief information officer at the
University of Michigan, having recently arrived from Carnegie-Mellon University.
And he was also the chief of the Merit Network, the network that connected our
three schools. And so they figured that once they didn't
get a supercomputer center, they'd better really pull out the stops so that they
would get the NSF Net. And of course they did get the NSF net and
Doug Van Houweling was the principal investigator for the NSF net 
starting in 1988. So, let's let Doug Van Houweling talk to,
tell you the story and I'll be back in a moment.
