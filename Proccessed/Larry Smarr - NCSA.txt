I'll show you the Berners-Lee footage,
it's I have to tell you that I'm a giant fan of yours. >> Oh really?
>> Yes I am. I mean I don't know you and I've never met you but I, it seems to me as
though maybe, maybe I'm just, it's just the Larry Smarr image rather than the
real Larry Smarr. >> You'll have to tell me what that is. [laugh] 
I'm the one person that never gets to see that. >> The Larry Smarr image?
>> Yeah, right. You don't know when you're inside it.
>> Yeah. I didn't know you were an astronomer. You know Bob Stein by any chance?
>> Sure. >> Bob Stein is my mentor. >> Really? Oh yeah, we gave Bob lots of time.
>> Yeah, I heard he's like in top five here. Bob is the guy that
taught me high-performance computing. >> I go way back with him.
Tom Wolf used to be a good friend of ours, before he had his
stroke or heart attack, or whatever it was. >> And, but I
mean to me it, after. >> So we don't get disrupted. Why don't you take this and
put it over there? Tell Tara to hold my calls, As to the why an astronomer
got into this... >> Yeah, go ahead. Right. >> Okay. >> I mean tell me,
tell me how this NCSA started. I mean, the, the whole purpose of this. >> Mm-hm.
>> is, is, it's sort of about NCSA. It's not as much about Netscape and Mosaic.
I mean, I'm curious, as a high-performance computing guy, about how, why, it happened here.
>> Right. >> Which is, I think >> Yeah. I can tell you about that.
>>. Okay. So go ahead. Tell me about NCSA. >> Okay. Does the little red light go on 
when you're >> Yep. I'm recording. >> Okay good. Well, I am a trained
relativistic astrophysicist. And I got my Ph.Ds always in physics
departments, working on astrophysics problems involving general relativity, gas
dynamics, and so forth. So in the 70s, when I was developing what is now called
numerical general relativity, which is the way to solve Einstein's equations for
dynamics of black holes, colliding black holes, or in astrophysics that required
general relativity like supernova events and so on, I had to go and get a top-secret
nuclear weapons clearance to get access to supercomputers, because in the mid-70s
the only place to get a supercomputer was either at Livermore, Los Alamos, or in one
area which was weather. Now astronomy has always been a driver of supercomputing
and in fact on Johnny von Neumann's computer that was built by the institute,
half of that went to Army, to Aberdeen. Half of that was used of course for the Army
for trajectory calculations but the other half was used for stellar evolution. So
astronomy and von Neumann's interest in weather meant that astronomy and weather
for 50 years basically have been dominant drivers of supercomputing usage. And yet
to do pure astrophysics you're having to get a top-secret nuclear weapons
clearance. Now, nobody seemed to think there was anything unusual about this. And
so I just went ahead as a post doc and I would get a few months in the summer, work
100 hours a week. And then, the rest of the year I'd had to live off of that. I'd go
back to Harvard where I was a junior fellow. Try to explain to them about, you
know, one could solve the laws of physics that we had been laying down for 300 years
in incredible detail for engineering devices like nuclear weapons that put on
Earth temperatures of the center of the sun, stresses beyond anything that we could
imagine in academic problems that we were trying to solve in lots of disciplines.
So, this thing could revolutionize academic research. Well, nobody got it. I
mean it was like, I really felt like I was transitioning in a flying saucer between
this advanced civilization at Livermore, and the stone-age culture at Harvard, and
Harvard was as advanced as any place in thinking about this, so it was a, what, I
didn't figure this out until it was in the early 80s and by then the first Cray had
gone into the continent of Europe at an open scientific institute, the Max Planck
Institute of Physics and Astrophysics. So I'm over there in the summer along with
people like Dave Arnet, who was one of the great supernova supercomputer guys in our
country, and people in chemistry, and it was like Paris in the 20s with all these
expatriates sitting over there. And we're like trying to figure this out, like this
is an American-built supercomputer, right? Why are we in Munich, right? I mean this
is very strange. So, but you know in America we don't question the
infrastructure somehow. I mean it's just like it's either there or it isn't there and
that's just the way it is. But I was having a mass of beer late one night, actually I think
it was the second mass of beer, with my German host who had also been born like I
was, postwar, and he finally turns to me and he says, aren't you ashamed of
yourself, you big, rich occupying country? You come over here in our little country
and, and we finally get enough money scraped together after World War II to
buy one of these supercomputers, and you Americans come over here and use up our
time. He says, how did you guys ever win the war? You know? What is going on here?
And this finally just sort of just stimulated me into saying, what is going on here?
This is nuts. And I went back and I found out, for instance, that after the Sputnik
Program, the Federal Government had funded the universities, built the science
buildings, started the supercomputer centers, IBM would go around and give away
almost the mainframes, and so the scientists in the 60s took it for granted
that they had the fastest computers in the world in academia. But about 1970, with
the starting of the Vietnam War, and with all kinds of guns and butters issues and
everything else, that stopped. And in fact, to give you an example, by 78, 
half the number of Ph.Ds and engineers in engineering was being generated in our
country as there were in 1970. So, there was this complete severing of the
Sputnik-era partnership with the Federal Government and it was particularly bad in
computing. To give you an example, when I was at Livermore in the 70s, there
were four CDC 7600s, which were just one of the finest supercomputers ever built. No
American university ever took delivery of a single CDC 7600. In fact, the University
of Illinois, when I first got here, had a Cyber 175 which was a retread, a second
design manufacturing of, of this thing. And we were one of the first universities
that had it, and people all thought that, you know, Illinois naturally was way ahead
of everybody else. So it's like, we were just completely divorced from the private
sector that was generating these wonderful machines because of federal policy, which
was to say, these things are only, are so valuable that we can only afford to put
them into war environments. So, after this German encounter I came back and I said, well gee,
I wonder how many other scientists like me are there. So, at the University of
Illinois, I started calling, cold calling my colleagues, and saying hi, you don't
know me. I'm a little assistant professor but I bet you that your research is
blocked by lack of access to supercomputers, and they'd sort of say
like, who? Crack, crack. Who is this? You know, [laugh] crank call and but we'd
start talking in chemistry and biology and agriculture and so on and, and sure
enough, it turns out that, that, that was true. They knew how to do the science,
they just didn't have access. So I said, well send me a little prospectus of what
science you could do if you had a supercomputer. Well, I ended up with 65
faculty and 15 departments on one campus and I thought, this is got to be
all this way all over the country so it was, I really said, well gee, somebody's
got to raise this issue. And about that time there had been a Lax Report, that had
the Federal Government had done that began to uncover some of this stuff and they still
weren't, I remember Peter Lax, he was one of the greatest mathematicians, head of, one of the 
top people in the Courant Institute, a long-time advocate of things computational, and I had
this long, long battle with Peter, because in the draft report of the Lax report, it
was not, it was going to say, well yeah, we ought to get one of these supercomputers
and make it available to the universities but, you know, let's put it at Livermore or
put it somewhere that people know how to do this stuff. And a university was not
on the list of what the Lax report considered to be appropriate sites for a
supercomputer. So I had this long battle over the telephone, I remember, with Peter
Lax. It was sort of David and Goliath because I mean he was this giant of the field and I'm
nobody. And I, I finally convinced him not to exclude universities as a possibility,
even though he felt that it was fairly unlikely that any of them would be able to
play with sharp instruments and not hurt themselves. So, I mean, you've got to
understand the world was totally different when the Supercomputer Center's program
was coming into being. And people, it's so hard for people now on the web and
everything to go back to that time. There was no Internet, you know? There was,
there was these wonderful people, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn and all
these people, Bill Joy, who had developed TCP/IP, and embodied it in the
ARPANET. This was a few computer science departments and military, okay? Nobody in
a physics department or chemistry department ever heard of the ARPANET, much
less had any access to it. But it was obviously the right idea. And so once we
got the Congress to put through money for a national supercomputer program, then
there was a national competition, and so on, and the five centers were selected.
The first thing then that NSF realized, well okay, now we put these in place to be
providing access to academic scientists, and yet, like, they have to fly to
Champaign-Urbana like I had to fly to Livermore, okay? This isn't right. So there
were a lot of discussions then. But the trouble was that the telecom lobbyists in
Washington would block any discussion of the Federal Government putting in the kind
of network we have today, which is what people wanted. I mean, everybody knew that
they wanted to have a ubiquitous email person-to-person network. But as soon as
they'd start talking about that the telecom lobbyists would come up and say,
no way, guys. That's private sector. Don't get the Federal Government involved in
that. Stay out of it. So what we learned early on is real interesting. It's like
if we had argued instead of the supercomputer program, let's get the
Federal Government to buy everybody a personal computer, which was IBM personal
computer was two years old in 1985, and put on people's desks, okay? Again, this would
be an interference with the private sector. So, but we said oh, we'll just take
a few of these esoteric supercomputers. And, is that okay? That's right, there's
no market there, that's okay, the Federal Government has a role. Well, it was the
same thing with networking. What we said is, we just want to put a high-speed
backbone across the country to connect the five centers and, and the telecom people
said, okay, that's cool, you know 56 kilobits was the national high-speed
backbone. Less than ISDN today. Yeah, that's not a market, okay? And, and
so we've got a few of these weird supercomputer types who are out in the
universities who want to hook into that. They said, yeah that's okay. That's
not a market. You can do that. Well, that was the NSF Net backbone. Then the
regionals got funded. And then the campuses were afraid if they didn't dig up
their quad and put in some fiber then the professors who wanted to get access to
supercomputers would go to a university that would do that, so gradually the whole
Internet emerged out of the, the sort of policy vise you get into Washington
where you can't do the right thing. You have to do something that seems
irrelevant, but has a logic to it that will gradually bring the market forces into
play. That will spin out, ultimately, a whole industry.
